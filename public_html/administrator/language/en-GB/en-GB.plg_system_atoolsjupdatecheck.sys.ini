PLG_ATOOLSJUPDATECHECK_DESCRIPTION="Automatically notifies Super Administrators about new versions of Joomla!. Includes a link which, when clicked, automatically logs in to your site's back-end and performs the upgrade using Admin Tools Professional. Requires the System - One Click Actions plugin to be published."
PLG_ATOOLSJUPDATECHECK_LANGUAGE_OVERRIDE_DESC="By default (if this option is left blank), the email Admin Tools sends to the Super Administrators when a new version of Joomla! is available will be in whatever the current user's front-end language is. In multilingual sites this can create confusion. You can choose the language of those email messages here, by entering the desired language tag. For example, in order to receive all emails in English, type en-GB in this field."
